**LeRobot** aims to provide models, datasets, and tools for real-world robotics in PyTorch. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry so that everyone can contribute to and benefit from shared datasets and pretrained models.

🤗 A hardware-agnostic, Python-native interface that standardizes control across diverse platforms, from low-cost arms (SO-100) to humanoids.

🤗 A standardized, scalable LeRobotDataset format (Parquet + MP4 or images) hosted on the Hugging Face Hub, enabling efficient storage, streaming and visualization of massive robotic datasets.

🤗 State-of-the-art policies that have been shown to transfer to the real-world ready for training and deployment.

🤗 Comprehensive support for the open-source ecosystem to democratize physical AI.

---

🤗 LeRobot aims to provide models, datasets, and tools for real-world robotics in PyTorch. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry to robotics so that everyone can contribute and benefit from sharing datasets and pretrained models.

🤗 LeRobot contains state-of-the-art approaches that have been shown to transfer to the real-world with a focus on imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

🤗 LeRobot already provides a set of pretrained models, datasets with human collected demonstrations, and simulation environments to get started without assembling a robot. In the coming weeks, the plan is to add more and more support for real-world robotics on the most affordable and capable robots out there.

🤗 LeRobot hosts pretrained models and datasets on this Hugging Face community page: [huggingface.co/lerobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot)

## Installation

LeRobot works with Python 3.10+ and PyTorch 2.2+.

### Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10 and activate it, e.g. with [`miniforge`](https://conda-forge.org/download/):

```bash
conda create -y -n lerobot python=3.10
conda activate lerobot
```

When using `conda`, install `ffmpeg` in your environment:

```bash
conda install ffmpeg -c conda-forge
```

> **NOTE:** This usually installs `ffmpeg 7.X` for your platform compiled with the `libsvtav1` encoder. If `libsvtav1` is not supported (check supported encoders with `ffmpeg -encoders`), you can:
>
> - _[On any platform]_ Explicitly install `ffmpeg 7.X` using:
>
> ```bash
> conda install ffmpeg=7.1.1 -c conda-forge
> ```
>
> - _[On Linux only]_ Install [ffmpeg build dependencies](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu#GettheDependencies) and [compile ffmpeg from source with libsvtav1](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu#libsvtav1), and make sure you use the corresponding ffmpeg binary to your install with `which ffmpeg`.

### Install LeRobot 🤗

#### From Source

First, clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
cd lerobot
```

Then, install the library in editable mode. This is useful if you plan to contribute to the code.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

It is best practice to use a virtual Python environment:

```bash
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
```

> **NOTE:** If you encounter build errors, you may need to install additional dependencies (`cmake`, `build-essential`, and `ffmpeg libs`). On Linux, run:
> `sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential python3-dev pkg-config libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libavfilter-dev`. For other systems, see: [Compiling PyAV](https://pyav.org/docs/develop/overview/installation.html#bring-your-own-ffmpeg)

For simulations, 🤗 LeRobot comes with gymnasium environments that can be installed as extras:

- [aloha](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-aloha)
- [xarm](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-xarm)
- [pusht](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-pusht)

For instance, to install 🤗 LeRobot with aloha and pusht, use:

```bash
pip install -e ".[aloha, pusht]"
```

### Installation from PyPI

**Core Library:**
Install the base package with:
LeRobot can be installed directly from PyPI.

```bash
pip install lerobot
lerobot-info
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For detailed installation guide, please see the [Installation Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/installation).

## Robots & Control

<div align="center">
  <img src="./media/readme/robots_control_video.webp" width="640px" alt="Reachy 2 Demo">
</div>

LeRobot provides a unified `Robot` class interface that decouples control logic from hardware specifics. It supports a wide range of robots and teleoperation devices.

```python
from lerobot.robots.myrobot import MyRobot

# Connect to a robot
robot = MyRobot(config=...)
robot.connect()

# Read observation and send action
obs = robot.get_observation()
action = model.select_action(obs)
robot.send_action(action)
```

**Supported Hardware:** SO100, LeKiwi, Koch, HopeJR, OMX, EarthRover, Reachy2, Gamepads, Keyboards, Phones, OpenARM, Unitree G1.

While these devices are natively integrated into the LeRobot codebase, the library is designed to be extensible. You can easily implement the Robot interface to utilize LeRobot's data collection, training, and visualization tools for your own custom robot.

For detailed hardware setup guides, see the [Hardware Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/integrate_hardware).

## LeRobot Dataset

To solve the data fragmentation problem in robotics, we utilize the **LeRobotDataset** format.

- **Structure:** Synchronized MP4 videos (or images) for vision and Parquet files for state/action data.
- **HF Hub Integration:** Explore thousands of robotics datasets on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/lerobot).
- **Tools:** Seamlessly delete episodes, split by indices/fractions, add/remove features, and merge multiple datasets.

```python
from lerobot.datasets.lerobot_dataset import LeRobotDataset

# Load a dataset from the Hub
dataset = LeRobotDataset("lerobot/aloha_mobile_cabinet")

# Access data (automatically handles video decoding)
episode_index=0
print(f"{dataset[episode_index]['action'].shape=}\n")
```

Learn more about it in the [LeRobotDataset Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/lerobot-dataset-v3)

## SoTA Models

LeRobot implements state-of-the-art policies in pure PyTorch, covering Imitation Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, with more coming soon. It also provides you with the tools to instrument and inspect your training process.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Gr00t Architecture" src="./media/readme/VLA_architecture.jpg" width="640px">
</p>

Training a policy is as simple as running a script configuration:

```bash
lerobot-train \
  --policy=act \
  --dataset.repo_id=lerobot/aloha_mobile_cabinet
```

| Category                   | Models                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **VLAs Models**            | [Pi0Fast](./docs/source/pi0fast.mdx), [Pi0.5](./docs/source/pi05.mdx), [GR00T N1.5](./docs/source/policy_groot_README.md), [SmolVLA](./docs/source/policy_smolvla_README.md), [XVLA](./docs/source/xvla.mdx) |

Similarly to the hardware, you can easily implement your own policy & leverage LeRobot's data collection, training, and visualization tools, and share your model to the HF Hub

For detailed policy setup guides, see the [Policy Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/bring_your_own_policies).

## Inference & Evaluation

Evaluate your policies in simulation or on real hardware using the unified evaluation script. LeRobot supports standard benchmarks like **LIBERO**, **MetaWorld** and more to come.

```bash
# Evaluate a policy on the LIBERO benchmark
lerobot-eval \
  --policy.path=lerobot/pi0_libero_finetuned \
  --env.type=libero \
  --env.task=libero_object \
  --eval.n_episodes=10
```

Learn how to implement your own simulation environment or benchmark and distribute it from the HF Hub by following the [EnvHub Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/envhub)
